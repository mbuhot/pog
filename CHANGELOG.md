# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Fixed a bug where queries inside `pog.transaction` did not respect the pool's
  `rows_as_map` configuration. Rows are now returned as maps when the pool is
  configured with `rows_as_map: True`, both inside and outside transactions.

## v4.1.0 - 2025-07-14

- Added a `numeric_decoder` to decode numeric types coming from postgres.

## v4.0.0 - 2025-07-07

- Starting a pool no longer generates an atom, instead a name is taken as an
  argument.
- The `Connection` type has been removed. A subject is now used instead.
- `connect` and `disconnect` have been removed in favour of `start` and `supervised`.
- `url_config` and `default_config` now take a name parameter.
- The `default_timeout` function has been removed.
- The callback given to the `transaction` function now receives the connection
  as an argument. Queries made using this connection will be in the
  transaction, while the pool can still be used to run queries outside the
  transaction.
- The `gleam_time` package is now used for time types and functions.
- The `TransactionError` type is now parameterised with an error type rather
  being specific to strings.

## v3.3.0 - 2025-07-03

- Updated `result.then` to `result.try` to resolve deprecation warnings.

## v3.2.0 - 2025-01-16

- The `url_config` function now defaults to port (5432) when port is not specified.

## v3.1.1 - 2025-01-02

- Fixed a bug where configuring SSL would crash.

## v3.1.0 - 2024-12-22

- Updated for `gleam_stdlib` v0.51.0.

## v3.0.0 - 2024-12-22

- Updated for `gleam_stdlib` v0.50.0.
- The `decode_*` functions have been replaced with `*_decoder` functions.
- `gleam/dynamic/decode.Decoder` is now used for decoding.

## v2.0.0 - 2024-12-21

- Add support for `sslmode` in connection strings.
- Change SSL from `Bool` to `SslVerified`, `SslUnverified` and `SslDisabled` to
  match against diverse CA certificates or not.

## v1.1.0 - 2024-12-11

- Added support for timeout in pool configuration as well as queries.

## v1.0.1 - 2024-11-26

- Corrected a mistake in the `array` function type.

## v1.0.0 - 2024-11-11

- Introduced the `Date`, `Time`, and `Timestamp` types.
- The default connection pool size is now 10.

## v0.15.0 - Unreleased

- Ensure `ssl` and `pgo` are running before using `gleam_pgo`.

## v0.14.0 - 2024-08-15

- Add ability to return rows as maps instead of tuple.

## v0.13.0 - 2024-07-17

- Host CA certs are now used to verify SSL by default.

## v0.12.0 - 2024-07-03

- Added the `transaction` function and `TransactionError` type.

## v0.11.0 - 2024-06-22

- Provided functions for handling date values. The `date` function
  coerces a `#(Int, Int, Int)` value representing `#(year, month, day)` into a
  `Value`. The `decode_date` function can be used to decode a dynamic value
  returned from the database as a date in the same tuple format.

## v0.10.0 - 2024-05-31

- The `uri_config` function now accepts the `postgresql://` scheme as well as
  the `postgres://` scheme.

## v0.9.0 - 2024-05-20

- Provided functions for handling timestamp values. The `timestamp` function
  coerces a `#(#(Int, Int, Int), #(Int, Int, Int))` value representing
  `#(#(year, month, day), #(hour, minute, second))` into a `Value`. The
  `decode_timestamp` function can be used to decode a dynamic value returned from
  the database as a timestamp in the same nested tuple format.

## v0.8.0 - 2024-05-20

- Added `array` column handling, accepting a `List` as value.

## v0.7.0 - 2024-04-05
